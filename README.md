- Stacked bar charts showing churn in percentage
- Multiple subplots comparing churn across key service-related columns

## Key Insights
- Month-to-month contracts and electronic check users show the highest churn
- Add-on services like Online Security and Tech Support reduce churn risk
- Senior citizens have a higher churn percentage despite being a smaller portion

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook for data exploration and visualization

## Outcome
- This analysis offers actionable insights that telecom businesses can use to:
- Design loyalty programs
- Promote bundled services
